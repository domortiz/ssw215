# QuaranSite

With the current COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine conditions that many find themselves in, it is important to unwind and keep yourself busy while staying safe and healthy.

Because of this, we have designed this site to help you pass the time!

Take our Netflix quiz to get some Netflix recommendations that you can watch today. Our quick and easy quiz will analyze your preferences and provide you with a show that we think you will enjoy.

Not only that, but we also created a script that grabs your top 5 artists from Spotify, and uses Spotify's recommendation API to create a new playlist for you to listen to! 

Stay home to save lives.
